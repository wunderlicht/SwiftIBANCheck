# IBANCheck

IBANCheck provides functionality to check IBANs for correctness.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number#Algorithms for details on how it works.

It all started when back in 2019 a team said they can't do it on time, so I volunteered. I took it as a side job to help out the company I was working for and also to et into Swift.
